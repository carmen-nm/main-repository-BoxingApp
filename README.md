## ABOUT THE PROJECT
This is an application for creating and managing your own boxing routines, accessing routines created by other users, sharing them, and more.

Firstly, to efficiently manage the usage of this application, you can create a user profile by clicking on the "SIGN UP" tab. Once you create your profile, you will be redirected to the "LOGIN" tab to log in with your username and password.

On the "EXERCISES" tab in the navigation bar, you will find a list of exercises that have been published by other users. Additionally, there is a section where you can create your own exercises. For each exercise, you need to provide a name, indicate the number of sets and repetitions, and include a descriptive image. These exercises can be part of your routines.

In the "ROUTINES" tab, you can view a list of existing routines and create new ones. You can also save your favorite routines to your user profile. To create a routine, you need to provide a name, specify whether it is a cardio or strength routine, estimate its duration, include an image, and list the required materials. Once created, from the detailed view of this routine, you can add exercises to it. Both the ones you have created and the ones created by other users.

Both the exercises and the routines can be modified or deleted.

In addition to the four mentioned routes, it is worth noting that for each created routine or exercise, a route will be generated where the detailed view can be found. From this view, you can also modify or delete any of these routines or exercises that you have created. There will also be a home route that describes the application and serves as the main access point for users.
